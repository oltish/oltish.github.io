<BLOCKQUOTE>FROM fairest creatures we desire increase,<BR>
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,<BR>
But as the riper should by time decease,<BR>
His tender heir might bear his memory:<BR>
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,<BR>
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,<BR>
Making a famine where abundance lies,<BR>
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.<BR>
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament<BR>
